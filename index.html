    <h2>Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>

    <section id="Synchronous_JavaScript" class="main-section">
      <header>Synchronous JavaScript</header>
      <p>To allow us to understand what asynchronous JavaScript is, we ought to start off by making sure we
        understand what synchronous JavaScript is. This section recaps some of the information we saw in the
        previous article.</p>
      <p>A lot of the functionality we have looked at in previous learning area modules is synchronous — you run
        some code, and the result is returned as soon as the browser can do so. Let's look at a simple example
      </p>
      <code>
        const btn = document.querySelector('button');
        btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        alert('You clicked me!');

        let pElem = document.createElement('p');
        pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
        document.body.appendChild(pElem);
        });
      </code>

      <p>In this block, the lines are executed one after the other:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>We grab a reference to a &lt;button&gt; element that is already available in the
          DOM.</li>
        <li>We add a click event listener to it so that when the button is clicked:</li>
        <li>An alert() message appears.</li>
        <li>Once the alert is dismissed, we create a element.</li>
        <li>We then give it some text content.</li>
        <li>Finally, we append the paragraph to the document body.</li>
      </ol>
      While each operation is being processed, nothing else can happen — rendering is paused. This is because as
      we said in the previous article, JavaScript is single threaded. Only one thing can happen at a time, on a
      single main thread, and everything else is blocked until an operation completes.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Asynchronous_JavaScript" class="main-section">
      <header>Asynchronous JavaScript</header>
      <p>For reasons illustrated earlier (e.g. related to blocking), many Web API features now use asynchronous
        code to run, especially those that access or fetch some kind of resource from an external device, such
        as fetching a file from the network, accessing a database and returning data from it, accessing a video
        stream from a web cam, or broadcasting the display to a VR headset.</p>
      <p>Why is this difficult to get to work using synchronous code? Let's look at a quick example. When you
        fetch an image from a server, you can't return the result immediately. That means that the following
        (pseudocode) wouldn't work:</p>
      <code>
        let response = fetch('myImage.png'); // fetch is asynchronous
        let blob = response.blob();
        // display your image blob in the UI somehow
      </code>

      <p>That's because you don't know how long the image will take to download, so when you come to run the
        second line it will throw an error (possibly intermittently, possibly every time) because the response
        is not yet available. Instead, you need your code to wait until the response is returned before it tries
        to do anything else to it.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of asynchronous code style you'll come across in JavaScript code, old-style
        callbacks and newer promise-style code. In the below sections we'll review each of these in turn.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="Async_Callbacks" class="main-section">
      <header>Async Callbacks</header>

      <p>Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start
        executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback
        function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened.
        Using callbacks is slightly old-fashioned now, but you'll still see them in use in a number of
        older-but-still-commonly-used APIs.</p>
      <p>An example of an async callback is the second parameter of the addEventListener() method (as we saw in
        action above):</p>

      <code>
        btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        alert('You clicked me!');

        let pElem = document.createElement('p');
        pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
        document.body.appendChild(pElem);
        });
      </code>
      <p>The first parameter is the type of event to be listened for, and the second parameter is a callback
        function that is invoked when the event is fired.

        When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function's
        reference as an argument, i.e, the callback function is not executed immediately. It is “called back”
        (hence the name) asynchronously somewhere inside the containing function’s body. The containing function
        is responsible for executing the callback function when the time comes.

        You can write your own function containing a callback easily enough. Let's look at another example that
        loads a resource via the XMLHttpRequest API (run it live, and see the source):</p>

      <code>
        function loadAsset(url, type, callback) {
        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('GET', url);
        xhr.responseType = type;

        xhr.onload = function() {
        callback(xhr.response);
        };

        xhr.send();
        }

        function displayImage(blob) {
        let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

        let image = document.createElement('img');
        image.src = objectURL;
        document.body.appendChild(image);
        }

        loadAsset('coffee.jpg', 'blob', displayImage);
      </code>
    </section>
    <section id="Promises" class="main-section">
      <header>Promises</header>
      <p>Promises are the new style of async code that you'll see used in modern Web APIs. A good example is the
        fetch() API, which is basically like a modern, more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest. Let's look at a
        quick example, from our Fetching data from the server article:</p>

      <code>
        fetch('products.json').then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
        }).then(function(json) {
        products = json;
        initialize();
        }).catch(function(err) {
        console.log('Fetch problem: ' + err.message);
        });
      </code>

      <p>Here we see fetch() taking a single parameter — the URL of a resource you want to fetch from the network
        — and returning a promise. The promise is an object representing the completion or failure of the async
        operation. It represents an intermediate state, as it were. In essence, it's the browser's way of saying
        "I promise to get back to you with the answer as soon as I can," hence the name "promise."

        This concept can take practice to get used to; it feels a little like Schrödinger's cat in action.
        Neither of the possible outcomes have happened yet, so the fetch operation is currently waiting on the
        result of the browser trying to complete the operation at some point in the future. We've then got three
        further code blocks chained onto the end of the fetch():</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Two then() blocks. Both contain a callback function that will run if the previous operation is
          successful, and each callback receives as input the result of the previous successful operation, so
          you can go forward and do something else to it. Each .then() block returns another promise, meaning
          that you can chain multiple .then() blocks onto each other, so multiple asynchronous operations can
          be made to run in order, one after another.
        </li>
        <li>
          The catch() block at the end runs if any of the .then() blocks fail — in a similar way to
          synchronous try...catch blocks, an error object is made available inside the catch(), which can be
          used to report the kind of error that has occurred. Note however that synchronous try...catch won't
          work with promises, although it will work with async/await, as you'll learn later on.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Conclusion" class="main-section">
      <header>Conclusion</header>

      <p>
        In its most basic form, JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language, in which only
        one operation can be in progress at a time. But web browsers define functions and APIs that allow us to
        register functions that should not be executed synchronously, and should instead be invoked
        asynchronously when some kind of event occurs (the passage of time, the user's interaction with the
        mouse, or the arrival of data over the network, for example). This means that you can let your code do
        several things at the same time without stopping or blocking your main thread.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether we want to run code synchronously or asynchronously will depend on what we're trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are times when we want things to load and happen right away. For example when applying some
        user-defined styles to a webpage you'll want the styles to be applied as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we're running an operation that takes time however, like querying a database and using the results to
        populate templates, it is better to push this off the main thread and complete the task asynchronously.
        Over time, you'll learn when it makes more sense to choose an asynchronous technique over a synchronous
        one.
